# Getting Started

To run the application with full functionality you need to:

1. Add your own Google Maps API key to the AndroidManifest.xml file in the Android project.
2. Add your own Bing Maps API key to the MainPage.xaml.cs file in the UWP project.
3. Publish either the API project or the Functions project to Azure or another hosting provider that provides SSL support.
4. Add your hosted URL to the TripLogCoreModule.cs file in the main project.
